# 🧭 Introduction
I built this Power BI project by following a tutorial from a [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/mmxVCFceQgU?si=zAtA1jhF-5Gq2bt4). While the structure and flow of the project closely follow the tutorial content, the process of building it helped me significantly strengthen my understanding of the Power BI development lifecycle — from data preparation to dashboard design.

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience with data modeling, DAX calculations, and effective visualization techniques. It served as a strong foundation for learning how to transform raw data into meaningful business insights using Power BI.
